```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href='/about'>
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent; 
```
This code will produce a warning in Next.js 13+ because the `href` prop of the `<Link>` component is not a valid URL.  This is an uncommon error because it's often easily overlooked, particularly when dealing with relative paths that might work in other contexts.

The issue is that the path `/about` needs to be accessible from the client-side and not only from the server.  If your `/about` page isn't properly configured (for instance, it doesn't exist or it requires additional server-side logic), then this is likely the culprit.
